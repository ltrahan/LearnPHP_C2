Chapter 2 - Review

- $_SERVER is a predefined variable

- $ 

- any letter or an underscore can be at the start of the variable name after the $,  after the first character then any letter, number or underscore can be used in the variable name.

- case sensitive

- scalar means is contains a single value, ie $my_number=10;  non-scalar refers to variables suchas arrays and objects

- the = sign is the assignment operator

- a great debugging technique is to print out the values of variables

- double quotes will get extrapolated,  single quotes will be treated literally
